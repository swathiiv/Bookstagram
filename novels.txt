
1. Faithful Jose

Chapter1

In a big beautiful palace there lived an old king who fell very sick one day. He had many servants and among them was a good servant Jose
 who had won the king s heart. The king thought that he was lying on his death-be so he said Let faithful Jose come to me.
Faithful Jose was his affectionate servant and was called so because he had been true to him all his lifetime. As soon as Jose came
 to the bedside, the king said My faithful Jose. I feel that my end approaches and I am worried about my son who is still so young that 
he cannot always guide himself aright. If you do not promise to instruct him in everything he ought to know and be his guardian I cannot 
close my eyes in peace.
Then Jose answered I will never leave him. I will always serve him truly, even if it costs my own life. So the king was very happy and said
Now I can die in peace. After my death you must show him all the chambers halls and vaults in the castle and all the treasures which are 
in them. But the last room in the long corridor you must not show him. Because in it hangs the portrait of the daughter of the king of the 
golden palace. if he sees her picture he will fall in great love with her and will fall down in a swoon and on her account will undergo 
great troubles. Therefore you must keep him away.
The faithful Jose pressed his masters hand again in token of his promise and a little later the king laid his head upon the pillow and expired.

Chapter2

After many days of the kings funeral the faithful Jose said to the prince who had now become the King.It is now time for you to see your
 inheritance. I will show you your paternal castle.So he led the prince all over it upstairs and downstairs and showed him all the riches and
 all the splendid chambers. Only one room he did not open containing the perilous portrait. The new king asked him Why do you not open
 that oneThere is something in it which will frighten you he replied.
But the young King said I have seen all the rest of the castle and I will know what is in there and he went and tried to open the door by force.
 The faithful Jose pulled him back and said I promised your father before he died that you shall not see the contents of that room. It would bring 
great misfortunes upon both you and me Oh no  replied the young King If I dont see it I cannot sleep peacefully in the night nor in the day.
 Now I won't leave this place till you unlock the door.
Then the faithful Jose saw that it was no use talking so with a heavy heart he took the key and opened the door of the chamber. When he had 
opened it he went in first and thought he would cover up the picture that the King should not see it. But it was of no use for the King stepped 
upon tiptoes and saw what he was not supposed to see and as soon as he saw the portrait of the maiden which was so beautiful and glittered
 with precious stones he fell down on the ground insensible.

Chapter 3
That is the daughter of the king of the Golden Palace replied Jose.Oh Jose My love for her is so great that I cannot live without her. My life 
is set upon the search for her. You are my faithful Jose. You must accompany me.The trusted servants deliberated for a long while how to
 set about this task for it was very difficult to get into the presence of the kings daughter. At last he found out a way and said to the king Everything 
which she has around her is of gold chairs tables dishes bowls and all the household utensils. Among your treasures are five tons of gold
lot one of the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture vessels and utensils of all kinds there from  all kinds of birds and wild and wonderful 
beasts such as will please her. Then we will travel with these and try our luck.The king summoned all his goldsmiths who worked day and night u
ntil many very beautiful things were ready. When all had been placed on board a ship, the faithful Jose put on merchants clothes and the king 
likewise so that they might travel quite unknown. Then they sailed over the wide sea and sailed away until they came to the city where lived the 
daughter of the King of the Golden Palace.Faithful Jose told the king to remain in the ship and wait for him. Perhaps said he I 
shall bring the kings daughter with me therefore take care that all is in order and set out the golden vessels and adorn the whole ship.
Thereupon Jose placed in a napkin some of the golden cups stepped upon the land and went straight to the kings palace. When he came
 into the castleyard a beautiful maid stood by the brook who had a golden pail in her hand drawing water and when she had filled it and had 
turned round she saw a strange man and asked who he was.Then Jose answered I am a merchant and opening his napkin he showed her
 its contents. Then she exclaimed Oh what beautiful golden things and she looked at the golden cups one after another and said The kings 
daughter must see these. She is so pleased with anything made of gold that she will buy all these. And taking him by the hand, she led him in for
 she was the ladys maid.When the kings daughter saw the golden cups she liked them all and said They are finely made. I will purchase them all.
 But faithful Jose replied I am only the servant of a rich merchant What I have here is nothing compared to what is there in our ship. Nothing more 
delicate or costly has ever been made in gold.
